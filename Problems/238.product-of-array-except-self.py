#
# Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is
# equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
# 
# The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit
# integer.
# 
# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the
# division operation.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
# Output: [24,12,8,6]
# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
# Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 2 <= nums.length <= 10^5
# -30 <= nums[i] <= 30
# The input is generated such that answer[i] is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit
# integer.
# 
# 
# 
# Follow up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The
# output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)
